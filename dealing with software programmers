Having worked in a multinational company,
I've had the privilege of having an in-house software management company at my disposal.
Although the HQ of the in-house software management company was located in another city,
a team of 10 software engineers were always present at our offices to assist us with our software needs.

The most frustrating part working with software engineers was agreeing on the amount of time and the budget required
to do the work that we needed to get done.
Since most managers in a typical company are not familiar with how softwares are developed and maintained, they believe it
to be an extension of simple computer usage especially with the development of today's IT technology.
So it was hard to convince internal managers of the need to allocate a certain amount of time and money for proper software development.

The one thing that I did take from this course was that in order to minimize disruptions, misunderstandings, and trial & error in
future software development/maintenance projects, there should be several things that I must adhere to.

1. Start with small things to have short cycle time and show tangible results 
2. Rather than demanding a timeline, always talk it over with engineers and come to a consensus
3. If there are pressing or urgent needs and not enough time remaining, come up with the next best alternative until
   the final programming can be finished
4. Look for ways for both sides to minimize costs
5. Provide clear cut objectives and requirments so as to minimize adjustments and/or changes during the actual programming phase

I believe that by following the principles above, I can more efficiently utilize the in-house software management resources in my firm.
